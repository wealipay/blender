/**
 * Manages unhandled rejection listeners to intelligently filter rejections
 * from aborted prerenders when cache components are enabled.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM:
 * When we abort prerenders we expect to find numerous unhandled promise rejections due to
 * things like awaiting Request data like `headers()`. The rejections are fine and should
 * not be construed as problematic so we need to avoid the appearance of a problem by
 * omitting them from the logged output.
 *
 * THE STRATEGY:
 * 1. Install a filtering unhandled rejection handler
 * 2. Intercept process event methods to capture new handlers in our internal queue
 * 3. For each rejection, check if it comes from an aborted prerender context
 * 4. If yes, suppress it. If no, delegate to all handlers in our queue
 * 5. This provides precise filtering without time-based windows
 *
 * This ensures we suppress noisy prerender-related rejections while preserving
 * normal error logging for genuine unhandled rejections.
